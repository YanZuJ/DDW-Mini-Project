## Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk

Open Terminal or Anaconda Prompt. Go to the folder of your project. For example,

```
$ cd ~/fip_powerx_mini_projects/mp_sort
```
or
```
> cd %USERPROFILE%\fip_powerx_mini_projects\mp_sort
```

1. Initialze the folder for EB repository by typing the following:

	```
	$ eb init -p python-3.6 miniproject1 --region us-east-1
	```

1. Run eb init again to configure a default keypair so that you can connect to the EC2 instance running your application with SSH:

	```
	$ eb init
	Do you want to set up SSH for your instances?
	(y/n): y
	Select a keypair.
	1) my-keypair
	2) [ Create new KeyPair ]
	```
	Select a key pair if you have one already, or follow the prompts to create a new one. If you don't see the prompt or need to change your settings later, run `eb init -i`.

1. Create an environment and deploy your application to it with `eb create <name of environment>`.
    ```
	eb create flask-env
    ```

    You will see a lot of messages on the screen, but the end, if everything is successful, you should see the following:
    ```
    INFO Successfully launched environement: flask-env
    ```

1. To open the web app in your browser, type:

	```
	$ eb open
	```

To check status of your instance, type:

```
$ eb status
```

## Terminating Instance

To terminate your instance, type:

```
$ eb terminate 
```
